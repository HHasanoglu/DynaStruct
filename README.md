# DynaStruct
Structural FE Solver with Dynamic Concepts
This GitHub repository contains a project focused on applying structural finite element (FE) analysis techniques and dynamic concepts to solve a variety of engineering problems. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient FE solver that can simulate structural behavior and dynamic response for various loading conditions.

The main features of the solver include:

A variety of element types, including beam, truss, plane stress/strain, and solid elements.
Linear and nonlinear material models for different types of materials.
Static and dynamic analysis capabilities, including time domain and frequency domain analyses.
Post-processing tools for visualization and analysis of results, such as stress/strain plots, deformation animations, and frequency response plots.
User-defined boundary conditions and loads for complex structural problems.

The project is designed to be modular and well-organized, making it easy to understand and customize for specific applications. The Devexpress library is used for creating a modern user interface and providing advanced data visualization and manipulation capabilities. The Math.NET Library is used for advanced mathematical computations and linear algebra operations, which are critical for solving complex structural problems.
